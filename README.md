LT<sub>E</sub>X LS (LT<sub>E</sub>X Language Server) implements a language server according to the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and provides grammar and spelling errors in markup documents (L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, Markdown, etc.). The documents are checked with [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/).

Typically, you start the language server (either locally or remotely), you send the language server your L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X or Markdown document, and it will respond with a list of the grammar and spelling errors in it. To use LT<sub>E</sub>X LS in this way, you have to use a language client (usually an editor or an extension of the editor) that communicates with LT<sub>E</sub>X LS according to the LSP.

However, it is also possible to supply LT<sub>E</sub>X LS paths to files and directories to be checked as command-line arguments. In this mode, LT<sub>E</sub>X LS will print the results to standard output, and no language client is necessary.

The reference language client of LT<sub>E</sub>X LS is the [LT<sub>E</sub>X extension for Visual Studio Code (vscode-ltex)](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex), whose development LT<sub>E</sub>X LS follows closely and vice versa.
